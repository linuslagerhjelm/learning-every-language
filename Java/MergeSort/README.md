#Mergesort
> In computer science, merge sort (also commonly spelled mergesort) is an
> efficient, general-purpose, comparison-based sorting algorithm. Most
> implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the implementation
> preserves the input order of equal elements in the sorted output. Mergesort is
> a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945

> Conceptually, a merge sort works as follows:
> 1. Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing 1 element (a list of 1
>    element is considered sorted).
> 2. Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only 1
>    sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list.

This Java class can be constructed using an Array List of integers that can then
be sorted when the _sort_ method is called. The sort will be performed using
merge sort
