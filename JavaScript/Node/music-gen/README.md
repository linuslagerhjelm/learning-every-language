#DDM music genereator
This repo is a javscript port of the DDM algorithm implemented in the paper [Six
Techniques forAlgorithmic Music
Composition](http://peterlangston.com/Papers/amc.pdf) by Peter S. Langston

It will algorithmically produce music which is outputted in a series of MIDI
tracks. Since the originial implementation only produces a series of MIDI tracks
and not an actual MIDI file. I have been unable to verify the success of this
port.
