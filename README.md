#Learning every language
I have found that a good way to learn a new language is to performe various
scripting tasks and implemnenting simple algorithms in that language. This repo is
going to cointain my colection of these implementations.

###Why put it openly on github?
It is my belief that people that also tries to learn new languages might
possible find some of these examples useful as they will provide some example
code with a well defined purpose that they can look at and learn from. 

###Your code suck!
I am aware that the code in this repo are likely to break a lot of best
practices for any language in question but everyone has at some point been a
beginner and you cannot be familiar with every quirk in a language at first. If
that puts you off then that is fine and this repo is not for you.

###Licensing
This entire repo is published with the MIT license which means that you can do
pretty much whatever you want with it. If you find some of the code here useful,
feel free to shout me out over on twitter
