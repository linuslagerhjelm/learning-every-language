#facerecognition
This is an implementation of the second assignment on the AI introduction course at Ume√• University. My original implementation can be found at: <https://github.com/MarcCoquand/facerecognition> 

It works by training on a set of provided training images of faces
representing the facial expressions Happy, Sad, Mischievous and Mad and uses
the provided examination set to verify the result of the training.

Usage (assuming that Julia is installed on your system):

```julia src/main.jl```
